### Campaign Conversion Prediction

This project is designed to predict campaign conversions using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The approach includes data analysis and preprocessing, followed by the application of multiple classification algorithms to compare performance and select the best model for the prediction task. The project phases are:

1. **Data Analysis**: An in-depth analysis of the data is performed to understand key features and their relationship with campaign conversions. This step is crucial for identifying patterns, trends, and influential variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This phase involves data cleaning, variable transformation, and preparation of datasets for machine learning models. It addresses aspects such as data normalization, categorical variable encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: Three different machine learning algorithms are applied for predicting conversions: RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. Each model is evaluated and compared to determine which provides the best performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 Score.

This comparative approach allows for the identification of the most effective algorithm for predicting campaign conversions, optimizing marketing strategies and improving data-driven decision-making.
