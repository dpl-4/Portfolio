### Employees Prediction and Analysis of Impact on the Company
This project aims to analyze employee data and predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company, as well as assess the economic impact of potential departures. The project is structured as follows:

1.- **Data Cleaning**: A thorough cleaning process is applied to the employee dataset to address issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the data is accurate and reliable for subsequent analysis.

2.- **Data Analysis and Feature Engineering**: Key patterns and features related to employee turnover are identified through data analysis. This includes exploring factors such as job satisfaction, tenure, department, and performance. Feature engineering is also conducted to create new variables that may be predictive of employee attrition.

3.- **Decision Tree Model**: A decision tree algorithm is implemented to predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company. This model helps identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover and provides insights into potential areas for intervention.

4.- **Economic Impact Assessment**: The project evaluates the financial impact of employee departures, including costs related to recruitment, training, and productivity loss. This analysis is crucial for understanding the broader implications of turnover on the company's performance.

5.- **Employee Retention Strategy**: Based on the findings, recommendations are made for developing an employee retention strategy. This includes targeted interventions to address the identified risk factors and improve overall employee satisfaction and engagement.

6.- **Visualization with Tableau**: A Tableau dashboard is created to present the key findings and insights in an accessible and interactive format. This visualization tool helps stakeholders quickly grasp the data and make informed decisions based on the analysis.

This project not only provides a predictive model for employee attrition but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing turnover and the associated costs. The insights gained are instrumental in shaping effective retention strategies and enhancing overall organizational stability.
