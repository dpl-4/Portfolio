### Leads Conversion

This project focuses on lead conversion using a comprehensive approach that includes data cleaning, analysis, preprocessing, and the application of a decision tree algorithm. The pipeline for this project consists of the following phases:

1. **Data Cleaning**: An extensive data cleaning process is conducted to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data, ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: This phase involves exploring the data to identify relevant patterns and features, as well as preprocessing steps such as normalization, categorical variable encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Decision Tree Model**: A classification model based on decision trees is implemented to predict lead conversion. This model is optimized using Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) to fine-tune hyperparameters, thereby improving classification accuracy and model performance.

The use of Grid Search CV allows for a systematic exploration of a wide range of hyperparameters, finding the best combination to enhance classification and increase model precision.

### Campaign Conversion Prediction

This project is designed to predict campaign conversions using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The approach includes data analysis and preprocessing, followed by the application of multiple classification algorithms to compare performance and select the best model for the prediction task. The project phases are:

1. **Data Analysis**: An in-depth analysis of the data is performed to understand key features and their relationship with campaign conversions. This step is crucial for identifying patterns, trends, and influential variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This phase involves data cleaning, variable transformation, and preparation of datasets for machine learning models. It addresses aspects such as data normalization, categorical variable encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: Three different machine learning algorithms are applied for predicting conversions: RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. Each model is evaluated and compared to determine which provides the best performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 Score.

This comparative approach allows for the identification of the most effective algorithm for predicting campaign conversions, optimizing marketing strategies and improving data-driven decision-making.
