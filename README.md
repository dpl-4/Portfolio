### Leads Conversion

This project focuses on lead conversion using a comprehensive approach that includes data cleaning, analysis, preprocessing, and the application of a decision tree algorithm. The pipeline for this project consists of the following phases:

1. **Data Cleaning**: An extensive data cleaning process is conducted to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data, ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: This phase involves exploring the data to identify relevant patterns and features, as well as preprocessing steps such as normalization, categorical variable encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Decision Tree Model**: A classification model based on decision trees is implemented to predict lead conversion. This model is optimized using Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) to fine-tune hyperparameters, thereby improving classification accuracy and model performance.

The use of Grid Search CV allows for a systematic exploration of a wide range of hyperparameters, finding the best combination to enhance classification and increase model precision.

### Campaign Conversion Prediction

This project is designed to predict campaign conversions using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The approach includes data analysis and preprocessing, followed by the application of multiple classification algorithms to compare performance and select the best model for the prediction task. The project phases are:

1. **Data Analysis**: An in-depth analysis of the data is performed to understand key features and their relationship with campaign conversions. This step is crucial for identifying patterns, trends, and influential variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This phase involves data cleaning, variable transformation, and preparation of datasets for machine learning models. It addresses aspects such as data normalization, categorical variable encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: Three different machine learning algorithms are applied for predicting conversions: RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. Each model is evaluated and compared to determine which provides the best performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 Score.

This comparative approach allows for the identification of the most effective algorithm for predicting campaign conversions, optimizing marketing strategies and improving data-driven decision-making.

### Employees Prediction and Analysis of Impact on the Company
This project aims to analyze employee data and predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company, as well as assess the economic impact of potential departures. The project is structured as follows:

1.- **Data Cleaning**: A thorough cleaning process is applied to the employee dataset to address issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the data is accurate and reliable for subsequent analysis.

2.- **Data Analysis and Feature Engineering**: Key patterns and features related to employee turnover are identified through data analysis. This includes exploring factors such as job satisfaction, tenure, department, and performance. Feature engineering is also conducted to create new variables that may be predictive of employee attrition.

3.- **Decision Tree Model**: A decision tree algorithm is implemented to predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company. This model helps identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover and provides insights into potential areas for intervention.

4.- **Economic Impact Assessment**: The project evaluates the financial impact of employee departures, including costs related to recruitment, training, and productivity loss. This analysis is crucial for understanding the broader implications of turnover on the company's performance.

5.- **Employee Retention Strategy**: Based on the findings, recommendations are made for developing an employee retention strategy. This includes targeted interventions to address the identified risk factors and improve overall employee satisfaction and engagement.

6.- **Visualization with Tableau**: A Tableau dashboard is created to present the key findings and insights in an accessible and interactive format. This visualization tool helps stakeholders quickly grasp the data and make informed decisions based on the analysis.

This project not only provides a predictive model for employee attrition but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing turnover and the associated costs. The insights gained are instrumental in shaping effective retention strategies and enhancing overall organizational stability.
